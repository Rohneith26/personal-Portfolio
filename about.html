  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m <strong>Rohneith Kotwal</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented <strong>Front-end Developer and UI/UX Designer</strong> with a focus on building clean, accessible, and engaging user experiences. I combine modern design thinking with deep knowledge of web development to craft responsive, scalable, and visually compelling websites and applications.
</p>

<p>
  My core strengths lie in technologies like <strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and React</strong>, paired with tools like <strong>Figma, Adobe XD, Git</strong>, and modern CSS frameworks like <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset — whether I’m designing an interface from scratch or optimizing performance for better user retention.
</p>

<p>
  Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects that span portfolios, landing pages, SaaS dashboards, and e-commerce front ends — always with a focus on both functionality and design harmony. I believe front-end development is where code meets creativity, and I take pride in writing maintainable, reusable code that complements the design vision.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond the technicals, I value strong communication, continuous learning, and collaboration. I’m a team player who adapts quickly, delivers under pressure, and takes feedback as a pathway to growth. I’m deeply committed to creating user-first solutions that are not just aesthetically pleasing but also inclusive and user-accessible.
</p>

<p>
  Whether I’m developing a pixel-perfect layout or experimenting with new UI patterns, I stay grounded in delivering meaningful digital experiences. I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can bring value to a mission-driven team while pushing my own boundaries as a developer and designer.
</p>

<p>
  If you're looking for a motivated front-end developer who understands both the language of code and the language of design — let’s connect. I'm ready to bring ideas to life.
